Originally I was a zoologist, studying behavioural ecology, with a BSc from University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and a D.Phil from Jesus College, Oxford. After a period doing post-doc research at Oxford and the University of Basel, Switzerland, I left the world of academia and became a software developer, primarily in Smalltalk and Ruby, but also Python, Objective C, and various other languages.

In 2020 I was fortunate enough to be made redundant after 15 years at JP Morgan Chase and had the opportunity to switch to Data Science and Machine Learning, and it has pretty much consumed my life ever since.
